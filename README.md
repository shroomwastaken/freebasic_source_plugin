# source plugin in freebasic
inspired by tsoding's freebasic stream

loads with `plugin_load` and is visible in `plugin_print` in portal 1

## building
make sure you have the latest freebasic compiler (fbc64) somewhere in your PATH, then run [compile.bat](./compile.bat)

result will be in repo folder under the name `fbsp.dll` along with a `libfbsp.dll.a` file

## why

suggestion by [evanlin](https://github.com/evanlin96069) after he saw the same tsoding stream i did. was fun

i wanted to see how long it'd take me to get it working, surprisingly it didn't take that long
